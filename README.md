## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I`m happy to finish this project as it will be my first ever completed and posted frontendmentor project!

My main focus with this project was to practice using vanilla JS flexbox & grid within breakpoints. These are all concepts I have been learning but up until now have not combined them all together in one site. I was less interested in focusing typography so for that reason it won`t look exactly like the original. 

The finished product is not perfect as there are some elements that would neeed work: the toggle nav button on resize & overflow of the body etc.

I hit alot of roadblocks along the way but was able to chip away at each through each and final made it through. 

### Continued development

I will continue honing my skills with flexbox, grid and vanilla JS. 

The CSS got messy near the end so I plan to use SASS & the BEM naming methodology on the next one.
